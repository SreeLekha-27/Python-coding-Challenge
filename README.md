# Python Coding Challenge

This repository is a **comprehensive Python practice guide** designed for beginners and intermediate learners. It includes **10 structured sessions** covering Python fundamentals, data structures, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP), with **practice questions and example programs**.

## Overview
- Learn Python step-by-step in 10 sessions
- Practice real-world programming problems
- Understand concepts through examples and outputs
- Consolidated exercises include: BMI calculator, shopping cart, student grades tracker, contact directory, calculator app, and banking system

## Purpose
- Strengthen Python programming skills
- Prepare for exams, interviews, and portfolio projects
- Learn coding best practices and problem-solving techniques

## Session-wise Highlights

### Session 1: Introduction to Python
- Basics, variables, data types, input/output, arithmetic operations

### Session 2: Strings & String Functions
- String creation, slicing, indexing, and methods
- Palindrome and substring problems

### Session 3: Tuples
- Creation, indexing, slicing, unpacking
- Immutable nature of tuples

### Session 4: Lists
- Creation, indexing, slicing, methods (`append`, `insert`, `remove`, `pop`, `sort`, `reverse`)
- Handling duplicates and mutable nature

### Session 5: Dictionary, Set & Frozen Set
- Key-value operations, set operations (union, intersection, difference), frozenset

### Session 6: Operators & Conditional Statements
- Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment operators
- Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, `elif`)
- Practical examples: even/odd, grading, leap year

### Session 7: Control Statements – While Loop
- While loops, break & continue
- Multiplication tables, number manipulation, guessing games

### Session 8: For Loop
- Loops with `range()` and `enumerate()`
- Nested loops, star patterns, iteration over strings/lists

### Session 9: Functions (Built-in & User Defined)
- Function definition, parameters, return values, default arguments
- Scope of variables, factorial, prime check

### Session 10: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes, objects, constructors (`__init__`), methods
- Real-world examples: Student, BankAccount classes
- Concepts: encapsulation, attributes, multiple objects
